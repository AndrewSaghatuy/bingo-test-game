We would like you to do the following kata: https://agilekatas.co.uk/katas/Bingo-Kata. We would like them to complete the exercise and send us a link to a Git repository with a solution that we can later discuss. Please have them commit changes as often as possible.

We are not asking them to complete all of the test cases (if they do, great! we might then have a more interesting conversation!).

After we receive the test results back, we will set up a meeting between Raul and one of our developers to discuss their approaches.
